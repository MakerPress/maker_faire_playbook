== Welcome to the Mini Maker Faire Playbook

Weâ€™d like to help you produce a great Mini Maker Faire in your local community. The Maker Faire Playbook shares the knowledge and experience from those people that created Maker Faire as well as those who have already produced a Mini Maker Faire. The playbook is written for the local organizer who serves as a representative of the Maker Faire community at large and well as a leader and producer of the local event.

We have published this document so that it might grow and reflect new practices and current experiences. If you are reading this in a PDF format and would like to contribute comments via email, please address them to minimakerfaire@oreilly.com.
